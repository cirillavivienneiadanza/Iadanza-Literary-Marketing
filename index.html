      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Cirilla Vivienne Iadanza, the founder of Iadanza Literary Marketing, dedicated to helping authors transform 
        their books into impactful, well-promoted works that reach the readers they deserve. With deep experience in book 
        promotion, platform growth, branding, and modern reader engagement, I deliver strategies that work in today’s 
        publishing landscape. My approach blends creativity, data, industry awareness, and a passion for amplifying an 
        author’s voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work closely with authors, publishers, and literary teams across genres, designing campaigns that elevate 
        visibility, maximize conversions, and build long-term readership. I understand the emotional and professional 
        investment that goes into creating a book, and I’m committed to making sure every author feels supported and seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're preparing for launch or seeking continuous growth, I help guide you through the process with 
        clarity and confidence. My mission is to ensure that authors not only publish great books but also cultivate 
        strong, lasting connections with readers.
